# Running a local php server

Assuming you have php installed (i.e. installed via homebrew), you can quickly launch a php server with the following command. This way you can avoid installing something heavy like MAMP. The command requires passing the host and port.

	$ cd /path/to/php/app
	$ php -S localhost:2000
