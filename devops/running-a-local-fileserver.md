# Running a local fileserver

If you find yourself in need of a quick file hosting solution it's possible to run one locally with python. Afterwards, use localhost or your machine's IP address to connect to it.

    $ cd path/to/files 
    $ python -mSimpleHTTPServer [port (optional, default is 8000)]
