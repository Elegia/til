# Diff files and folders

Sometimes you find yourself with two sets of the same files, but you're not sure how they differ from one another. To check which files differ, use the **diff** tool.

    diff --brief -Nr dir1/ dir2/


Drop the -N flag if you don't want new/deleted files marked as a difference.
